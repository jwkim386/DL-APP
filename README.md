# 2022-1 Deep Learning and Applications

In this lecture, we will be learning about two different topics in deep learning: self-supervised learning (SSL) and generative models. For SSL, 50 papers were curated in computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. 

### Syllabus
- Week 1: Historical Review
- Week 2: Self-supervised learning 1 (Jigsaw, BiGAN, RotNet, Auto-Encoding Transform, DeepCluster, Single Image SSL)
- Week 3: Self-supervised learning 2 (SimCLR)
- Week 4: Self-supervised learning 3
- Week 5: Self-supervised learning 4
- Week 6: Invited Talk
- Week 7-9: Presentations
- Week 10: Generative Model 1 (AR model, ML learning)
- Week 11: Generative Model 2 (VAE, WAE, GAN, Flow-based models)
- Week 12: Generative Model 3 (DDPM)
- Week 13: Generative Model 4 (More diffusion-based models)
- Week 14-16

##### This syllabus is subject to further change or revision, as needed, to best realize the educational goals of the course.
